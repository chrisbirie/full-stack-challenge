# full-stack-challenge

## Introduction
This repository is a series of challenges in building a full stack application. The challenge is coding language/stack agnostic and is up to the developer to choose how to develop each portion of the application and ensure that the integrations between the pieces work together. The challanges are fairly bare bones and the developer has the flexibility to make each piece as simple or complex as they choose. Each challenge builds on the previous, so doing the labs out of order is not recommended.


## Full Stack Application
A Full Stack Application is an application that has components for the Front End Client, The Back End Server and the Data Layer. When added together, you have a complete application that users can interact with and the interactions and data can be saved and retrieved.

Popular Full Stacks include:
- MEAN Stack: MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node
- MERN Stack: MongoDB, Express, React, Node
- Django Stack: Django, python, MySQL
- Rails (Ruby on Rails): Ruby, PHP, MySQL
- LAMP Stack: Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP

## Front-end (Client) Applications
The front end of an application is responsible for the user experience. This is typically done using a webpage, web application, or mobile application. The user interacts with the front end of the application, which then interacts with the Back-End of the application which pulls data from the Data layer to display to the user.

Front-end applications are usualy build by some combination of the below technologies:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

Front End Libraries and Frameworks
- Node (Angular, React, Vue)
- Python (Django)
- C#
- Ruby (Ruby on Rails)
- Bootstrap
- jQuery
- SAAS

## Back-end (Server) Applications
The back end server is responsible for interacting with the data layer and sending data to the client typically VIA APIs

Back End Libraries and Frameworks
- Java (Spring)
- Python (Django)
- Node (Express)
- C#
- Ruby (Ruby on Rails)

## Data Layer
The database is where the data is stored. This is typically done using Databases but it is also possible to store data using files, but this is typically not recommended for larger datasets. Databases can either be relational or non relational (NoSQL)

Data Layer Technologies
- Oracle (Relational)
- MySQL (Relational)
- Amazon RDS (Relational)
- Microsoft SQL Server (Relational)
- PostgreSQL (Relational)
- Microsoft Access (Relational)
- SQLite (Relational)
- MongoDB (Non Relational)
- Amazon DynamoDB (Non Relational)

# Challenges
There are a series of challenges for building a full stack application. Before starting the challenge, select a tech stack, install it and be comfortable with programming with it.
